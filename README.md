## Problem Statement
In today’s world, technology is playing a leading role in people’s lives. Mankind is not just assured to be able to have synchronous verbal connections between people living at a far distance from each other (sometimes on two opposite sides of the globe), but it has also made sure that, with the use of the internet, people can even see each other, which gives the population a possibility to feel like they would be together.

Despite these incredible opportunities, many contacts are still weakening or even being lost. In an ideal world, the next step would be that people don’t just keep in touch through long conversations, but even through activities that requires only a few minutes of one’s precious time.

The idea behind our thinking is that “coldened relationships” could be well mitigated with the use of technologies that are most of the time with their users and providing fast interaction between user and device. The most operated tools for such purposes are smartphones. The goal of this research paper is to develop an application that could run on these devices and be spread among as many smartphone owners as possible.

One of the biggest dilemmas of this project is: how can we develop a software that is user friendly and could run connected on many mobiles from all over the world simultaneously, with the knowledge that has been obtained so far at Aalborg University. Besides the question about technological solutions, an important issue could be the actual needs of the users. It is crucial to have “hands on” research on the market that could give a proper picture about what form the game should take, in order for it to become widely used on the market.
